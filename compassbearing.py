    Calculates the bearing between two points.

    The formulae used is the following:
        θ = atan2(sin(Δlong).cos(lat2),
                  cos(lat1).sin(lat2) − sin(lat1).cos(lat2).cos(Δlong))

    :Parameters:
      - `point_a: The tuple representing the latitude/longitude for the
        first point. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees
      - `point_b: The tuple representing the latitude/longitude for the
        second point. Latitude and longitude must be in decimal degrees

    :Returns:
      The bearing in degrees
